Spring Data JPA
1. Add Dependency
2. Write appropriate properties in application.properties file
3. Annotate Entity(Model) class with appropriate JPA annotation
4. Write an interface, extend this interface from JpaRepository interface

Spring Data JPA gives built in interface like JpaRepository which we need to extend in our old interface
This interface gives us built in methods for CRUD operations.
C - Create
R - Read
U - Update
D - Delete 

We don't have to write implementation to this interface.
